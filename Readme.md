## How to setup networking?
Open the Unity Asset Store (can do from the Unity app itself) and
search for **PUN2 - FREE** (Photon Networking free tier), add it and import it.
For the setup, it asks for the app ID. Ask me (Arturs) for it and I'll give it to you,
I don't want to put it on a public repo.
Additionally, it might be useful to select *Window -> Photon Unity Networking -> Highlight Server Settings*
and specify **App Version: 0.1** and **Fixed Region: eu**.

You can also run the networked version on the desktop. Run the desktop client **first**, before
opening up the mobile app, so the desktop client acts as the master client.
